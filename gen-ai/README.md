# Gen AI Setup
This directory should serve as a place to hold some helpful markdown scripts as it relates to Gen AI.

I was blessed from my time at AWS to learn from lots of people on how to prompt and how to develop with GenAI.

At AWS, we use Kiro-CLI, however the world at large obviously use Claude-Code. I will keep this directory as agent agnostic, however likely in the long term it will become all claude-code.

## TODO: 
[X] - Develop a script that can produce a properly formatted PRD for the various tasks
[ ] - Develop a planning script that can be used to create tasks form said PRD
[ ] - Develop a script Spin up agent for task management/ralph agent 

## Aside
- I will be testing these scripts using Kiro-CLI on my personal website project
