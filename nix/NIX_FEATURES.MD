After installing using NIX here is what we noticed
- does the symlink still exist for our nix config, or is it not even needed?
- raycast automatically symlinked to command space 
- pinned dock items
- output for apps that stil need action
- install git in the bootstrapping script
- direction to generate a token for git
- home brew gets installed before we use it
- add git config for my labtop
